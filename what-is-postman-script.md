We can create some dynamic behavior to your API requests with Postman's built-in javaScript runtime. Write test scripts to check for a specific status code, set a variable, or validate a response. We can also use scripts to process data and build dynamic workflows.

Postman can run scripts before a request is sent (pre-request) or after (post-response). We can also create packages for your favorite scripts and reuse them across your Postman team.
